## Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Edson Cabral

I'm a Fullstack Developer and DevOps student quite curious and joining a ton of new 
programming languages. I truly love to make a bunch of thing just to test new 
programming languages, frameworks or libraries.

I've been building a lot of things using Vue, React, Angular, Typescript, Rust, 
Go, C#, .NET Core, etc. However, my main stack is Node with Typescript, and I'm also working with Go.

I'm currently working at [iBlue Consulting](https://www.iblueconsulting.com.br/) 
as a Fullstack Node. I'm also trying to work on open-source projects, helping and 
learning from the community.
